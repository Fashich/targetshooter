# Target Shooter

Target Shooter is an interactive web-based game designed to train reflexes, accuracy, and response speed. With a simple yet challenging mechanic, the game challenges players to shoot red targets as quickly as possible using left-click mouse inputs. Each precise shot increases the score, while missed shots reduce lives. The primary goal is to achieve the highest score before lives run out!

## Description

Target Shooter offers a dynamic gameplay experience focused on improving mental and physical agility. Players must react swiftly to randomly appearing targets on the screen. The faster a player shoots the targets, the higher their score. Mistakes or delays reduce lives, adding time pressure and intensity to the game.
